1.what is the difference between "==" and "===" ?
```
answer
```
In JavaScript, == is the equality operator, which checks for equality of two values after converting them to a common type. This process is known as type coercion. For example:

javascript
Copy code
1 == '1' // true, because '1' is converted to a number
On the other hand, === is the strict equality operator, which checks for equality without performing any type conversion. Both the value and the type of the operands must be the same for === to return true. For example:

javascript
Copy code
1 === '1' // false, because the types are different
In general, it's considered best practice to use === for comparisons to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.
```

2.what is difference between break and continue
```
answer
```
break and continue are both keywords used in loops in JavaScript to alter the flow of the loop, but they serve different purposes:

break statement:

When the break statement is encountered inside a loop (for, while, or do...while), the loop is terminated immediately, and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
It is often used to exit a loop early if a certain condition is met.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4
continue statement:

When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration of the loop is terminated, and the program control goes to the next iteration.
It is often used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration if a certain condition is met, but the loop itself continues to the next iteration.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 3 4
In summary, break is used to exit the loop entirely, while continue is used to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

3.what are the three phase of promise
```

answer
```
In JavaScript, a Promise can be in one of three states:

1.Pending: Initial state of a promise. It represents that the operation represented by the promise has not yet completed and is still pending.

2.Fulfilled: The state of a promise representing a successful operation. If a promise is fulfilled, it means that the operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.

3.Rejected: The state of a promise representing a failed operation. If a promise is rejected, it means that the operation encountered an error or was unsuccessful, and the promise has a reason (an error or rejection message).
```

question

```
4. what is promise ?
```
answer

```
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or executing a time-consuming task without blocking the main thread.

A Promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: Initial state of a promise. It represents that the operation represented by the promise has not yet completed and is still pending.

Fulfilled: The state of a promise representing a successful operation. If a promise is fulfilled, it means that the operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.

Rejected: The state of a promise representing a failed operation. If a promise is rejected, it means that the operation encountered an error or was unsuccessful, and the promise has a reason (an error or rejection message).

Once a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, it is considered settled, and its state cannot be changed again. Promises provide a cleaner alternative to traditional callback-based asynchronous code and allow for easier chaining of asynchronous operations using the then and catch methods.

example:-

// Example function that returns a Promise
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { message: 'Data fetched successfully' };
            // Resolve the promise with the data
            resolve(data);
            // Uncomment the line below to simulate a rejection
            // reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data'));
        }, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second delay
    });
}

// Using the fetchData function
console.log('Fetching data...');
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log('Data:', data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
    });
```

question

```
5. what is closure ?
```

answer

```

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to "remember" and access the variables of the outer function, even when the outer function is no longer in scope.


Here's a simple example to illustrate closure:

function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function';
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const inner = outerFunction(); // inner is now a closure
inner(); // Output: I am from the outer function
```
question

```
6. what is callback ?
```
answer

```
when a function is called inside another function as a varible , we call it callback function

Example of callback function :- 

  // Define a function that takes a callback as an argument
function fetchData(callback) {
    // Simulate a delay with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Data fetched');
        // Execute the callback function
        callback();
    }, 2000); // 2-second delay
}

// Define a callback function
function processData() {
    console.log('Processing data');
}

// Call fetchData and pass processData as a callback
fetchData(processData);
```

question

```
7. what is hoisting ?
```
answer

```
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code is executed. This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in your code.

Variable Hoisting
For variables declared with var, the declaration is hoisted to the top of its function or global scope, but not the assignment.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
var myVar = 5;
console.log(myVar); // Output: 5
In this example, the declaration var myVar; is hoisted to the top, so console.log(myVar); before the assignment logs undefined. The assignment myVar = 5; is not hoisted.

Function Hoisting
Function declarations are hoisted entirely, meaning you can call a function before you define it in your code.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
sayHello(); // Output: Hello!

function sayHello() {
    console.log('Hello!');
}
In this example, the entire function sayHello is hoisted, so you can call it before its definition.

let and const Hoisting
Variables declared with let and const are also hoisted, but unlike var, they are not initialized with undefined. They are placed in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered, making it an error to access them before they are declared.

Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(myLet); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
let myLet = 5;

console.log(myConst); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myConst' before initialization
const myConst = 10;
In this example, accessing myLet and myConst before their declarations results in a ReferenceError.
```
question

```
8. what is difference between "var", "let" and "const" ?
```
answer

```
In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different characteristics and behaviors. Here are the key differences:

var üëç


Scope:

var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in.
If declared outside any function, it has global scope.
Hoisting:

Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined.
Re-declaration:

You can re-declare a var variable within the same scope without an error.
Global Object Property:

Variables declared with var at the global level become properties of the global object (e.g., window in browsers).
Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // No error
console.log(x); // Output: 20





let üëç




Scope:

let is block-scoped, meaning it is accessible only within the block (enclosed by {}) it is declared in.
Hoisting:

Variables declared with let are hoisted but not initialized. They are in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered, which results in a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration.
Re-declaration:

You cannot re-declare a let variable within the same scope.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
y = 20; // Allowed
// let y = 30; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
console.log(y); // Output: 20





const üëç




Scope:

const is block-scoped, similar to let.
Hoisting:

Variables declared with const are hoisted but not initialized. They are also in a "temporal dead zone" until the declaration is encountered.
Re-declaration and Re-assignment:

You cannot re-declare a const variable within the same scope.
You cannot re-assign a const variable after it has been assigned a value. However, if the const variable is an object or array, the properties of the object or elements of the array can be modified.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
console.log(z); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'z' before initialization
const z = 10;
// z = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
const obj = { a: 1 };
obj.a = 2; // Allowed
console.log(obj.a); // Output: 2
Summary
Scope: var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped.
Hoisting: var variables are hoisted and initialized with undefined. let and const variables are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a "temporal dead zone."
Re-declaration: var can be re-declared within the same scope, but let and const cannot.
Re-assignment: let can be re-assigned, while const cannot be re-assigned, though the contents of objects and arrays declared with const can be modified.
These differences are crucial for understanding how to properly declare and use variables in different contexts in JavaScript.
