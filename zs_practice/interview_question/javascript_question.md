```
1.what is the difference between "==" and "===" ?
```
answer
```
In JavaScript, == is the equality operator, which checks for equality of two values after converting them to a common type. This process is known as type coercion. For example:

javascript
Copy code
1 == '1' // true, because '1' is converted to a number
On the other hand, === is the strict equality operator, which checks for equality without performing any type conversion. Both the value and the type of the operands must be the same for === to return true. For example:

javascript
Copy code
1 === '1' // false, because the types are different
In general, it's considered best practice to use === for comparisons to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.

2.what is difference between break and continue
```
answer
```
break and continue are both keywords used in loops in JavaScript to alter the flow of the loop, but they serve different purposes:

break statement:

When the break statement is encountered inside a loop (for, while, or do...while), the loop is terminated immediately, and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
It is often used to exit a loop early if a certain condition is met.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i === 5) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 2 3 4
continue statement:

When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the current iteration of the loop is terminated, and the program control goes to the next iteration.
It is often used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration if a certain condition is met, but the loop itself continues to the next iteration.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 2) {
        continue;
    }
    console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0 1 3 4
In summary, break is used to exit the loop entirely, while continue is used to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop.

3.what are the three phase of promise
```

answer
```
In JavaScript, a Promise can be in one of three states:

1.Pending: Initial state of a promise. It represents that the operation represented by the promise has not yet completed and is still pending.

2.Fulfilled: The state of a promise representing a successful operation. If a promise is fulfilled, it means that the operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.

3.Rejected: The state of a promise representing a failed operation. If a promise is rejected, it means that the operation encountered an error or was unsuccessful, and the promise has a reason (an error or rejection message).
```

4. what is promise ?
```
answer

```
A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or executing a time-consuming task without blocking the main thread.

A Promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: Initial state of a promise. It represents that the operation represented by the promise has not yet completed and is still pending.

Fulfilled: The state of a promise representing a successful operation. If a promise is fulfilled, it means that the operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.

Rejected: The state of a promise representing a failed operation. If a promise is rejected, it means that the operation encountered an error or was unsuccessful, and the promise has a reason (an error or rejection message).

Once a promise is either fulfilled or rejected, it is considered settled, and its state cannot be changed again. Promises provide a cleaner alternative to traditional callback-based asynchronous code and allow for easier chaining of asynchronous operations using the then and catch methods.

example:-

// Example function that returns a Promise
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = { message: 'Data fetched successfully' };
            // Resolve the promise with the data
            resolve(data);
            // Uncomment the line below to simulate a rejection
            // reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data'));
        }, 2000); // Simulating a 2-second delay
    });
}

// Using the fetchData function
console.log('Fetching data...');
fetchData()
    .then((data) => {
        console.log('Data:', data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error.message);
    });
```

question

5. what is closure ?
```

answer

```

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer function's variables and parameters, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to "remember" and access the variables of the outer function, even when the outer function is no longer in scope.


Here's a simple example to illustrate closure:

function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = 'I am from the outer function';
    
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // innerFunction has access to outerVariable
    }

    return innerFunction;
}

const inner = outerFunction(); // inner is now a closure
inner(); // Output: I am from the outer function
```
